Ejemplo de aparato crítico (Goodyear, comentarios preliminares a Libro I, capítulo 2)

**I. 2. 1 postquam...mallent** A sentence of unusual length for T., but worlds apart from the familiar Ciceronian and Livian periods. In a manner peculiarly Tacitean it represents the gradual and calculated encroachment of Augustus on the power of Senate and people. There is no smooth building up to an inevitable climax. Instead the articulation is disjointed, constructions change abruptly or are left unfinished, and thought crowds upon thought suddenly and tangentially. The sentence is overloaded, but also overpowering in its force. See F. Klingner, *Hermes* 83 (1955), 192-4 (= *Studien* 664-5) for some perceptive remarks on Tacitean sentence-structure, and A. Kohl's important study, *Der Satzanachirag bei Tacitus*, Würzburg 1960, passim.
