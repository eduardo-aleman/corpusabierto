Extracto a manera de ejemplo del aparato crítico de Goodyear en los comentarios del comienzo del capítulo 1.

**P. Cornelii Taciti**  
T.’s *praenomen* is uncertain. M₁ in its subscriptions to books 1 and 3 gives *P. Corneli*.[^1] M₂ does not give a *praenomen* at all. No ancient writer who refers to T. uses a *praenomen*, until Sidonius (Ep. 4.14.1, 22.2), who calls him *Gaius*.[^2] There is no sure way of resolving the conflict of evidence.[^3] I believe Sidonius is the more likely to be unreliable, and so follow M₁.

The form *Cornelii* which M₁ offers (M₂ in its subscriptions varies between *Cornelii* and *Corneli*) is, of course, perfectly acceptable in itself. Cf. Plin. *Ep.* 9.23.2 *Corneli* Taciti (MS authority here favours *Cornelii*), Quint. 1.5.8 *Corneli* Galli, and see Kühner-Holzweissig 451. But it is more probable that T. wrote *Cornelii*, since, if we may trust the transmission, he habitually prefers the longer form, e.g. *Cornelii* at iii.4.1 and 3.58.2.

## Liber I ab excessu divi Augusti

The conventional modern title *Annales*[^4] has no MS authority and no ancient corroboration which will bear close examination. F. Jacoby, *Atthis*, Oxford 1949, 111, mistakenly supposes that at 4.32.1 T. uses the title *Annales* of his books *ab excessu divi Augusti*.[^5] That passage is not so to be interpreted (see Syme 253 n. 1). In T. *annales* has become generalized in meaning, or at least the sense ‘annals’ (i.e. annalistic history) is not always clearly present. Thus 2.88.3 *Graecorum annalibus ignotus* means ‘unknown to Greek history’, 3.65.1 *praecipuum munus annalium* ‘the principal function of history’, and …

## Footnotes

[^1]: At the top of the page before the beginning of book 1 a different, but perhaps not very late, hand has added *P. Cornelii*. See Rostagno’s facsimile of M₁ p. vii and W. Studemund, *Hermes* 8 (1874), 232–3. In the subscription to book 2 a later hand has added *P. Cornelii*. The subscription to book 4 does not give the name, and subscription is lacking at the end of book 6.  
[^2]: This is supported, for what their support is worth, by some fifteenth-century MSS.  
[^3]: It is conceivable that both M₁ and Sidonius are wrong or guessing.  
[^4]: In his edition of 1533 Beatus Rhenanus called all the major historical writings *Annales*, presumably basing his conjecture on T.’s use of the word. This name held good only until 1574 when Lipsius established the separate titles *Annales* and *Historiae* which have since become conventional. He presumably based the distinction not only on the passages of Tertullian (see below) which mention books of the *Histories*, but also on the alleged difference of meaning between *historia* and *annales* advanced by Servius on *Aen.* 1.373, namely that *historia* applies to events in the writer’s lifetime, *annales* to earlier events.  
[^5]: In fairness to a great scholar, I add that this error is merely an incidental part of a good discussion of the decline of *Athhides* and *Annales* after the loss of political freedom.
